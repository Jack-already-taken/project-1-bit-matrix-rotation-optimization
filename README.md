# Project 1: Bit Hacks

See [Project 1: Instructions](https://github.com/eec289q-f23/project1-instructions) for assignment details. You must accept the GitHub "invite" to this EEC289Q-F23 organization to see the instructions. It was sent to the username you used for HW1. If you want to use a different username for whatever reason, message Collin on Slack and he will send out a second invite to you.

As usual, we may update the instructions if there are any issues. If that happens we will announce it on Slack with an @mention so you're notified. You may also do the following.
- Click on the instructions link above to go to the GitHub page
- Find the "Watch" button, click it
- Select "All Activity", and you'll get emailed if anything changes

We are using GitHub classroom like last time, which works as follows. When you "accept" the assignment, a new repository is made just for you with the code necessary to run the experiments. Only you and the instructors can see this repository. You "submit" the assignment by modifying this code, adding new files, and pushing all changes to this repository. When you are entirely done, you go to Canvas and upload a PDF of your write up with a link to your GitHub assignment repository. *All homework will be graded approximately 5-6 days after the due date* to allow for all late assignments to be submitted (up to 3 days) before grading begins.

This repository contains the necessary code to get you started. Have fun!
